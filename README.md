# The super tiny compiler (in zig)

This is a re-implementation (without the AST transformation step) of the [super tiny compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler). 

I wrote this in zig to learn more about the language while also exploring compilers. To run the program, you can either build it with `zig build` and then run the program in `zig-out/bin/tiny-compiler-zig`, or run `zig build run`.
